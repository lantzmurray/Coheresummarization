AI Summatization Project using Cohere's API 

Hello,

This is a AI Summarization Project that I created using Cohere's API  along with Tkinter.

To start this project I first created my UI using Figma.  Once my UI was complete I then had to convet the code to python to use Tkintker.  To do this I used Tkinter designer.  
You can find it at:
https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer

Once I had my layout in py format I connected it to the Cohere Summarization API .   
Thie will allow input text to have a summarization generated at the click of a button.

In order to use this, you will need to go to Cohere's website and sign up and then request a Free api key.    
If you don't see the key in the settings section you can grab it from the code on the playground tab.

That is also a good time to ensure that you are seeing code 200 at the bottom of the Cohere screen (successful). 
If you aren't getting seeing this you'll want to follow Cohere's API error handling web page.

Normally things should be okay with your key and you can enter it into the applciation.

To generate a summarization you'll need both the API key and the original text in the correct field.
Upon generating the summarization, anything in the output field will be erased and a new output will be placed there after a few seconds.   

To make the files into an executable program I used auto-py-to-exe.  

Thank you for checking out this project.
